i need to make an mobile app "Swift Aid" that tackles with problems like Emergency medical response systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to delayed dispatching, lack of real-time GPS tracking, and suboptimal route planning, leading to prolonged response times. Additionally, inadequate communication between hospitals, ambulances, and patients creates uncertainty in critical situations. The challenge is further exacerbated in remote and underserved areas, where limited connectivity and infrastructure hinder timely access to life-saving medical assistance. and key solution is Live GPS Tracking: Real-time tracking of ambulances with location updates Smart Route Optimization: AI-based shortest route suggestions, avoiding traffic congestion.Integrated Web Platform: A web page accessible by hospitals, emergency responders, and users for seamless coordination.Automated Status Updates: Ambulance availability, estimated arrival time, and patient status updates.User-Friendly Interface: Simple design for easy navigation by hospitals, patients, and ambulance drivers.AI-driven Route Optimization: Unlike basic GPS trackers, your system actively suggests the best route in real time. Public and Hospital Integration: Both hospitals and users can track ambulances, improving transparency. Live Data Analytics: Insights on response time, route efficiency, and demand hotspots.Custom Alerts & Notifications: Real-time alerts for patients and hospitals regarding ambulance arrival. in the app the first user interface is to choose if the user is a patient or dispatch center and then it opens to a different page with user interface to login with your username, password and signup with options like email and username etc appropriate for the kind of user(dispatch center or patient). now after login new interface comes with where you can see the map with the closest ambulances and hospitals, view profile, notifications(alerts), fleet overview. in the view profile section put a section for patient user to input there emergency conact members information. use https://c6b9f7d8-a2b3-4b8c-a5f9-e09771d6fa0d-00-2r88f81njyghb.picard.replit.dev/ as a refrence in the view profile overview
